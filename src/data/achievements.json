          "description": "This research addresses the challenges of managing vast data generated by IoT devices in cloud environments, focusing on optimizing resource utilization, energy efficiency, and privacy. We propose a Fuzzy-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) framework that intelligently allocates IoT data to cloud resources by handling uncertainties in resource availability and privacy sensitivity. The framework significantly enhances resource efficacy, achieving 89% resource utilization, 98.5% privacy sensitivity, and reduces energy consumption to 0.7 kWh. This work demonstrates a holistic approach to efficient and secure IoT data management in cloud environments."
